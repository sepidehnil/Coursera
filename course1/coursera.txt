I am an Iranian resident, living in the city of Tehran. As a recent college graduate, I intend to continue further education while also seeking internship opportunities to provide temporary financial security. I come from a working-class family . My family has had several challenges in paying for my tuition and maintaining a comfortable living.
Although my parents supported me in the best possible ways they could, I received limited financial assistance due to my low family income. I do not wish for them to keep funding me, it is a huge burden on them already. As a low-income student, I'm aware of the lack of financial resources and how it limits one's choices and prevents them from fulfilling their potential.
I was referred to this course by one of my seniors. I checked the syllabus and found that it can potentially boost my skill set and profile. Apart from that, it's a great opportunity to learn from the best of professors.
